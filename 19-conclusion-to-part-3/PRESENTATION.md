## What have you learned?

- Network programming with UDP with all its elements:
  - reliability
  - unicast, broadcast and multicast
  - messaging patterns
  - service discovery protocols
- The differences between TCP and UDP

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1549228581-cdbdb7430548?fit=crop&h=720)

## What have you accomplished?

- You have implemented an UDP application in Java with some concurrency patterns (for some)
- You have defined your own application protocol (again, yeah!)
- Deeper usage of Docker and Docker Compose to build, share and run your network application

## Evaluation

In order to validate this part of the course, you will have to pass an
evaluation. The questions will be in French and you can answer them in French or
English.

The evaluation will be in two parts:

1. A theoretical part (35 minutes)
2. A practical part (25 minutes)

A break of 10 minutes will be given between the two parts.

---

The following chapters will be evaluated:

- [Define an application protocol](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/tree/main/09-define-an-application-protocol)
- [Docker and Docker Compose](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/tree/main/10-docker-and-docker-compose)
- [Java UDP programming](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/tree/main/17-java-udp-programming)

### Theoretical part

The evaluation will be done on paper. You might be asked questions about the
theoretical content, the practical content and elements seen in the practical
work.

You can only have access to your own notes in paper format. Your notes must fit
on one sheet of paper (recto). They can contain anything useful to you:
definitions, schemas, code snippets, etc. You will be able to use them during
the exam at the end of the semester.

All typical questions are at the end of each chapter you studied.

### Practical part

The evaluation will be done on the computer. You will be asked to create a
simple program using vanilla Java (`java` and `javac`). You will then send us
your code by email (old-school but it the easiest way).

You can use all the tools you want: your own IDE, ChatGPT, Copilot, the official
Java documentation, your old practical works, etc.

The statement will be on paper. You are not allowed to copy it in electronic
format to feed it to ChatGPT or Copilot.

### Resources

For both parts, no communication between students is allowed and external help
from a human is not allowed. You must do the work yourself.

Cheating is not allowed. If you are caught cheating, you will get a 1 for the
evaluation.

All previous evaluations are available in the
[`evaluation-and-exam-archives`](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/tree/main/00-evaluation-and-exam-archives)
folder of the course repository.
