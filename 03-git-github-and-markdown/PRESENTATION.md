## Conclusion

<!-- _class: lead -->

### What did you do and learn?

In this chapter, you have installed and configured Git properly. You have also
created your own GitHub account and profile README for your future social
profile as a computer scientist engineer.

Finally, you have added yourself to the list of students in the GitHub
organization using the issue, fork and pull request workflow, enabling you to
contribute to open source projects in the future.

Git is a valuable tool for collaborative work but we only scratched the surface.

chapter?

This will help us to improve the course and adapt the content to your needs. If
we notice some difficulties, we will come back to you to help you.
