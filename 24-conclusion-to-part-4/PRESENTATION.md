## Evaluation

You might be asked questions about the theoretical content, the practical
content and the practical work.

We might ask you to analyze or code a small program to solve a problem, describe
a schema and/or explain a concept.

All typical questions are at the end of each chapter you studied.

The evaluation will be done on the computer. You will have to be connected to
the
[VPN](https://intranet.heig-vd.ch/services/informatique/poste-de-travail/reseau/vpn/Pages/vpn.aspx).
It is **mandatory**.

---

You can have access to the course material including your own notes and the
[official Java documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/).
Other websites are not allowed.

No communication between students is allowed.

ChatGPT, Copilot or any other AI assisted tools are not allowed during the
evaluation.

Cheating is not allowed. If you are caught cheating, you will get a 1 for the
evaluation.

All previous evaluations are available in the
[`archives`](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/tree/main/00-evaluation-and-exam-archives)
folder of the course repository.
