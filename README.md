## Course planning and material

This course is equivalent to 3 ECTS credits = ~75-90 hours of work.

- 48 hours in class (= 64 periods of 45 minutes)
- ~27-42 hours outside of the class - We try our best to ensure you do not have
  to work that much outside of the class

64 periods in class are planned for this course, divided in 4 main parts:

- [Part 1 - Input/output processing (15 periods)](#part-1---inputoutput-processing-15-periods)
- [Part 2 - Network programming with TCP (18 periods)](#part-2---network-programming-with-tcp-18-periods)
- [Part 3 - Network programming with UDP (16 periods)](#part-3---network-programming-with-udp-16-periods)
- [Part 4 - Web infrastructures (12 periods)](#part-4---web-infrastructures-12-periods)

The entire course planning for the semester is available at
