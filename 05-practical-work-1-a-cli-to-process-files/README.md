# Practical work 1 - A CLI to process files

<https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course>

L. Delafontaine, J. Ehrensberger and H. Louis with the help of Copilot

In this practical work, you will create a CLI to process files. The CLI will take an input file and an output file as arguments. It will also take the input file encoding and the output file encoding as arguments. The CLI will process the input file and write the result in the output file. It will display a message on success and a message on failure. It will also display the execution time.

You will create two versions of the CLI. The first version will not use buffers. The second version will use buffers. You will compare the two versions.

You will define what the CLI will do. You can choose to copy the input file to the output file, to convert the input file to uppercase, to convert the input file to lowercase, to convert the input file to a specific encoding, etc.

Multiple groups can choose the same processing and you can share your methodology but please do not copy/paste code from other groups.

## Objectives

- Create a CLI to process files
- Learn how to use Java IOs to process files with different encodings

## Group composition

You will work in groups of two students. You can choose your partner. If you do not have a partner, we will assign you one.

## Evaluation grid

- 0 point - The work is not done
- 0.1 point - The work is insufficient
- 0.2 point - The work is done

Maximum grade: 30 points * 0.2 = 6

## Constraints

- The CLI must be written in Java
- The CLI must be built using Maven
- The CLI must be tested using JUnit

## Resources

Everything is presented in the following sessions:

- [Git, GitHub and Markdown](../02-git-github-and-markdown/README.md)
- [Java, Maven and JUnit](../03-java-maven-and-junit/README.md)
- [Java IOs](../04-java-ios/README.md)

## Feedback

Please take a few minutes to give us some feedback about this session. It will help us to improve it for the next one!

[GitHub Discussions - Git, GitHub and Markdown - Feedback](https://github.com/orgs/heig-vd-dai-course/discussions/1)

We are interested to see if the session was too theoretical / too practical, too slow / too fast, too easy / too difficult, not enough time / too much time, useful / not useful, etc.
