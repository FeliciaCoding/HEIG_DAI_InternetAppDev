## Objectives

So far in the course, you have built network applications using the TCP and UDP
protocols.

You have mastered these protocols and you are now able to build network
applications using them.

TCP and UDP are low-level protocols. They are used to transfer data between
computers. They do not define how the data should be structured.

It is up to the developers to define how the data should be structured, using an
application protocol, for example.

This is where the HTTP protocol comes into play.

In this final part, you will learn how to use the HTTP protocol to build network
applications using all the features offered by this protocol.

This will allow you to build more complex network applications, built on top of
a solid foundation: HTTP.

As HTTP offers many features and is a very complex protocol, this chapter will
be a mixed between theory and practice to introduce you to the most important
concepts.

## Disclaimer

In this chapter, you will use the [`HttpServer`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/jdk.httpserver/com/sun/net/httpserver/HttpServer.html) class from the [`com.sun.net.httpserver`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/jdk.httpserver/com/sun/net/httpserver/package-summary.html) package of the [`jdk.httpserver`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/jdk.httpserver/module-summary.html) module.

This class is not part of the Java standard library. It is part of the JDK. This
means that it is not available on all Java platforms.

If you want to develop a network application using HTTP that you want to use in
production, you will have to use a third-party library such 
as [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) or [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).

As these libraries are out of the scope of this course (and mostly because you will see them details in future courses), we will not use them.

Using the `HttpServer` class is a good way to learn the basics of HTTP and to
experiment with it.

## Prepare and setup your environment

### Start and configure curl

In this section, you will start [curl](https://curl.se/) using its official
Docker image available on Docker Hub: <https://github.com/curl/curl-container>.

To start curl, run the following command:

```sh
# Pull the Docker image
docker pull curlimages/curl:latest

# Start the Docker image
docker run --rm curlimages/curl:latest
```

The output should be similar to the following:

```text
Unable to find image 'curlimages/curl:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from curlimages/curl
96526aa774ef: Already exists
b3ed3d59459c: Pull complete
4f4fb700ef54: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:4a3396ae573c44932d06ba33f8696db4429c419da87cbdc82965ee96a37dd0af
Status: Downloaded newer image for curlimages/curl:latest
curl: try 'curl --help' or 'curl --manual' for more information
```

Now start the container overwriting the default entrypoint to access the
container:

```sh
# Start the Docker image
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint /bin/sh curlimages/curl:latest
```

The output should be similar to the following:

```text
~ $
```

You are now in the container. You should be able to use `curl` inside the
container for the following sections. To exit the container, type `exit` and
press `Enter`.

### Create and configure a new IntelliJ IDEA project

In this section, you will create a new IntelliJ IDEA project to experiment with
HTTP in the next sections.

Create a new IntelliJ IDEA project as seen in previous chapters with Maven.

### Update the `Main.java` file

Update the `Main.java` file with the following code:

```java
package ch.heigvd;

import com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpExchange;
import com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.net.InetSocketAddress;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class Main {

    public static final int PORT = 8080;
    public static final int NUMBER_OF_THREADS = 2;

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        HttpServer httpServer = HttpServer.create(
                new InetSocketAddress("0.0.0.0", PORT),
                0
        );

        httpServer.createContext(
                "/",
                (HttpExchange exchange) -> {
                    try (OutputStream os = exchange.getResponseBody()) {
                        String response = "Hello, world!";

                        exchange.sendResponseHeaders(200, response.length());
                        os.write(response.getBytes());
                    } catch (IOException e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }
                }
        );

        httpServer.setExecutor(Executors.newFixedThreadPool(NUMBER_OF_THREADS));

        httpServer.start();

        System.out.println("Server started on port " + PORT);
    }
}
```

Run the application and open your browser at <http://localhost:8080>. You
should see the following:

```text
Hello, world!
```

Using curl, you can also access the server:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8080
```

The output should be the same as in the browser.

This file will be our starting point for the next sections. In future sections,
we will refer to this file as `Main.java`.

### Explore and understand the code

Let's take a look at the code.

```java
        HttpServer httpServer = HttpServer.create(
                new InetSocketAddress("0.0.0.0", PORT),
                0
        );
```

This line creates a new HTTP server listening on the port `8080`. The hostname `0.0.0.0` means that the server will listen on all network interfaces.

The `0` parameter is the backlog. It defines the maximum number of pending
connections the server can have. It is not important for this course.

```java
        httpServer.createContext(
                "/",
                (HttpExchange exchange) -> {
                    try (OutputStream os = exchange.getResponseBody()) {
                        String response = "Hello, world!";

                        exchange.sendResponseHeaders(200, response.length());
                        os.write(response.getBytes());
                    } catch (IOException e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }
                }
        );
```

This line creates a new context for the server. A context is a path on the
server. In this case, the context is `/`. This means that the server will
respond to requests to the path `/`.

The second parameter is a [`HttpHandler`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/jdk.httpserver/com/sun/net/httpserver/HttpHandler.html). It is a functional interface that
defines a method to handle HTTP requests. In this case, the method is a lambda
expression that sends a response to the client.

```java

        httpServer.setExecutor(Executors.newFixedThreadPool(NUMBER_OF_THREADS));

```

This line sets the executor of the server. The executor is used to process
requests. In this case, we use a fixed thread pool with 2 threads.

```java
        httpServer.start();
```

This line starts the server.

You now have a basic HTTP server running on your computer. It is time to learn
more about HTTP!

## HTTP

Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a protocol used to transfer data over the
Web. It is a client-server protocol based on the request-response pattern.

HTTP was initiated by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989. It was first used in 1990
to transfer Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) documents.

HTML is a markup language used to create web pages that interconnect with each
other. It is the primary language used to create web pages.

Over the years, HTTP and HTML have evolved. HTTP is now used to transfer
different types of data (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, videos, etc.).

Built on top of TCP, HTTP offers numerous features that make it a very powerful
protocol.

HTTP uses the TCP port 80 by default.

HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP. It uses the TCP port 443 by default.

There are several versions of HTTP. The most used are HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 and
HTTP/3.

Each version of HTTP saw the introduction of many features over the years.

The different versions are:

- HTTP/0.9 (1989)
- HTTP/1.0 (1996)
- HTTP/1.1 (1997)
- HTTP/2 (2015)
- HTTP/3 (2022)

Most features are retro-compatible. This means that a client using HTTP/1.1 can
communicate with a server using HTTP/2.

As of today, HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 are still the most used versions of HTTP.

### HTTP/0.9

The first version of HTTP was HTTP/0.9 in 1989. It was a very simple protocol
only meant to transfer HTML documents.

### HTTP/1.0

HTTP/1.0 was released in 1996. It introduced many features that are still used
today (among others):

- HTTP headers
- HTTP status codes
- HTTP methods
- Documents other than HTML (images, videos, etc.) are supported

### HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 was released in 1997, an improved and faster version of HTTP/1.0. It
introduced many features that are still used today (among others):

- Persistent connections - The connection between the client and the server is
  kept alive after the response is sent. This allows the client to send multiple
  requests over the same connection. Which is more efficient.
- Additional cache control features
- Content negotiation - The client can ask for a specific version of a resource
  (HTML, CSS, etc.)
- Thanks to the `Host` header, it is possible to host multiple websites on the
  same server

### HTTP/2

HTTP/2 was released in 2015. The biggest change is the use of a binary protocol
instead of a text protocol. This makes it more efficient.

As no much new features were introduced, HTTP/2 was quickly adopted by the
industry.

### HTTP/3

HTTP/3 is the latest version of HTTP. It was released in 2022. It is based on
the QUIC protocol instead of TCP. QUIC is based on the UDP protocol, making it more efficient.

The main point of HTTP/3 is to make the Web faster and more secure, using a more
efficient protocol based on UDP.

## The HTTP protocol

HTTP is a client-server protocol. It is based on the request-response paradigm:
a client (called **user agent** in the HTTP specification) sends a request to a
server, the server processes the request and sends a response to the client.

A client can be a web browser, a command line tool, a mobile application, etc.

The client requests a resource from the server. A resource can be a web page, an
image, a video, etc.

A resource is identified by a URL. The URL is composed of the following parts:

- The protocol (`http` or `https`)
- The domain name (or IP address) of the server (e.g. `gaps.heig-vd.ch`)
- The port number (optional, e.g. `:80` for HTTP or `:443` for HTTPS)

The URL can also contain the following parts:

- The path to the resource (e.g. `/`)
- The path parameters (optional, e.g. `/users/{user-id}`, where `{user-id}` is a
  path parameter)
- The query parameters (optional, e.g. `?q=hello`)
- The fragment (optional, e.g. `#section-1`)
- The subdomain (optional, e.g. `api.`)

In order to get a resource from a server, the client must send a request to the
server. The request contains the following information:

- The HTTP method
- The URL of the resource
- The HTTP version
- The HTTP headers
- The HTTP body (optional)
- The query parameters (optional)
- The cookies (optional)
- The content type (optional)

The server processes the request and sends a response to the client. The
response contains the following information:

- The HTTP version
- The HTTP status code
- The HTTP headers
- The HTTP body (optional)
- The cookies (optional)
- The content type (optional)
- The content length (optional)
- The content encoding (optional)

### Structure of a HTTP request

A HTTP request is structured as follows:

```text
<HTTP method> <URL> HTTP/<HTTP version>
<HTTP headers>
<HTTP body>
```

An example of a HTTP request:

```text
GET / HTTP/1
Host: gaps.heig-vd.ch
User-Agent: curl/8.1.2
Accept: */*
```

In this example, we request the resource `/` from the server `gaps.heig-vd.ch` using
the HTTP method `GET` using the curl command line tool.

You can reproduce this request using curl:

```sh
# Send a GET request to GAPS
curl -v http://gaps.heig-vd.ch
```

The `-v` option tells curl to print the request headers.

The default HTTP method is `GET`. This means that you can omit the HTTP method. A browser always requests a resource using the HTTP method `GET` by default.

The output should be similar to the following:

```text
*   Trying 193.134.218.91:80...
* Connected to gaps.heig-vd.ch (193.134.218.91) port 80 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: gaps.heig-vd.ch
> User-Agent: curl/8.1.2
> Accept: */*
> 
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

</head>

<body>
  [...]
</body>

* Connection #0 to host gaps.heig-vd.ch left intact
</html>
```

The `>` symbol indicates the request headers sent by the client.

The `<` symbol indicates the response headers sent by the server.

The first lines of the request is:

```text
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: gaps.heig-vd.ch
> User-Agent: curl/8.1.2
> Accept: */*
```

The `Accept` header tells the server that the user agent accepts any type of
content in return.

### Structure of a HTTP response

A HTTP response is structured as follows:

```text
HTTP/<HTTP version> <HTTP status code> <HTTP status message>
<HTTP headers>
<HTTP body>
```

An example of a HTTP response:

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 27 Nov 2023 17:42:47 GMT
Server: Apache
Last-Modified: Thu, 23 Feb 2023 15:00:12 GMT
ETag: "17df-5f55f450264dd"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 6111
Vary: Accept-Encoding
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: sameorigin
Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
<html>

<head>
  <title>GAPS/SACHEM</title>
  <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1">
  <LINK rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" type="text/css">
  <link rel="shortcut icon" href="/img/favicon.ico" />
</head>

<body>
  [...]
</body>

</html>
```

In this example, the server responds with the resource `/` using the HTTP status
code `200` (OK). The server also sends the content of the resource (the HTML).
The `Content-Type` header tells the client that the content is HTML with the
charset `ISO-8859-1`.

Many other headers are sent by the server. They are not mandatory and some are
out of the scope of this course.

You can reproduce this request using curl:

```sh
# Send a GET request to GAPS
curl -i http://gaps.heig-vd.ch
```

The `-i` option tells curl to print the response headers.

### HTTP methods

The HTTP method defines the action to be performed on a resource. The most used
methods are:

- `GET` - Get a resource
- `POST` - Create a new resource
- `PATCH` - Partially update a resource
- `PUT` - Update a resource
- `DELETE` - Delete a resource

A server exposes a set of resources. Each resources can have a different set of
HTTP methods associated with it.

Let's update the `Main.java` file to demonstrate this:

```java
TODO
```

For example, the resource `/api/users` on the server `gaps.heig-vd.ch` could be
accessed using the HTTP methods `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH` and `DELETE`:

- `GET /api/users` - Get all users
- `POST /api/users` - Create a new user
- `PATCH /api/users/{user-id}` - Partially update user with ID `{user-id}`
- `DELETE /api/users/{user-id}` - Delete user with ID `{user-id}`
