## Grades and feedback

Grades will be entered into GAPS, followed by an email with the feedback.

The evaluation will use exactly the same grading grid as shown in the course
material.

Each criterion will be accompanied by a comment explaining the points obtained,
a general comment on your work and the final grade.

If you have any questions about the evaluation, you can contact us!

## Finished? Was it easy? Was it hard?

Can you let us know what was easy and what was difficult for you during this
practical work?

This will help us to improve the course and adapt the content to your needs. If
we notice some difficulties, we will come back to you to help you.
