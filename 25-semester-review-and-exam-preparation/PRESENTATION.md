### With great power comes great responsibility

You have gained significant knowledge during this course. Use this knowledge
wisely. My personal closing remarks are the following:

- **Always stay critical!** Don't believe everything you read or hear!
- **Always ask yourself questions!** _Why?_ _How?_ _What?_ _Am I doing the right
  thing for the right cause?_ _Do I listen to myself?_
- **Always do what is good for you!** Health, relationships, friends are more
  important than work! You are more important than work!
- **Always trust yourself and your guts!** Do what you think is right!

### Thank you, good luck, and farewell!
