## My wishes for this course

<!-- _class: lead -->

### What I want this course to be

- A place to learn
- A place to experiment
- A place to share
- A place to have fun
- A place where you help each other
- A place where you do not loose your time (efficient and useful)

### What I don't want this course to be

- A place you don't want to come
- A place you don't feel comfortable/safe
- A place where you can't ask questions
- A place where you can't take anything away
- If you have a problem with the course, I will do my best to fix it.

I will not take presences during this course. If you are done, you are free to go but I would appreciate if you try to help your classmates instead!

## Where to find the course material

**Everything** will be on the GitHub organization created for this course: <https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course>.

More specifically, the course material is available in the [`heig-vd-dai-course`](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course) Git repository.

I will not use Microsoft Teams nor CyberLearn. I want to keep it simple and efficient for you and me. One place to find it all.

_PS: I accept pull requests if you spot anything weird! :sparkles:_

## Communication channels

Feel free to use any of these communication channels for any kind of questions related to the course:

- GitHub Discussions (you will experiment these very soon)
- In person
- Email
    - [ludovic.delafontaine@heig-vd.ch](mailto:ludovic.delafontaine@heig-vd.ch)
    - [hadrien.louis@heig-vd.ch](mailto:hadrien.louis@heig-vd.ch)

## Course sequence

1. Theoretical content you acquire on your own
    - A set of READMEs, slides and/or videos for you to read/watch
2. Practical content where you do stuff (:exploding_head:)
    - You will be able to experiment the theoretical content
3. Practical work (the time available should be sufficient)
    - Bigger work to get deeper into the subject
4. Feedback and discussion (few minutes - most important to me)
    - You will be able to give feedback and share your experience

## Evaluation

## Responsibilities and expectations

- My responsibilities:
    - You have acquired the necessary knowledge of this course
    - You are prepared for the professional world
    - You are able to work in a team
    - You are able to work on your own

- Your responsibilities: you are responsible for your own learning. If you have any questions, ask them. If you have any difficulties, let me know. If you have any suggestions, share them.

## _"A course in English..? Why This Fantasy?"_

All the written material will be in English. The speaker will talk in French.

This is meant to prepare you for the future. Our field is mostly made in English so this is a great opportunity to practice your English skills.

Evaluations will be in English as well but you can answer the questions in French if you prefer.

If you have any difficulties with English, please let me know.

## _"What about ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.?"_

You can use all the tools you want (personal notes, Internet, ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.), even during evaluations. My statement is that you will be able to use these in the real world, so better learn how to use them now. However, they are here to help you, not to do the work for you:

- You must be able to explain what you did and why you did it
- You must state it when you used external help (tools and sources)
- You must be able to do the work on your own. These tools come and go ($$$, end of life, etc.), you should not entirely rely on them. 

## _"Linux, macOS or Windows?"_

The HEIG-VD recommends Windows for your studies. This is mostly because other departments heavily use Windows-only products. From my experience, developing on Windows can be more difficult than Linux or macOS.

Linux and macOS are much more supported in the software development world. If you can, I recommend you to try a Linux distribution (Ubuntu, Fedora or Debian) for this course, either baremetal or in Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL). It will be useful in your future to have a bit of experience with it as well.
