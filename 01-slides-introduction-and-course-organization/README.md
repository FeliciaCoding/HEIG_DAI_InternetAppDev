## What does GAPS say?

![](https://picsum.photos/720?image=3)

## What I want this course to be

- A place to learn
- A place to experiment
- A place to share
- A place to have fun
- A place where you help each other

## What I don't want this course to be

- A place you don't want to come
- A place you don't feel confortable/safe
- A place where you can't ask questions
- A place where you can't take anything away

## Where to find the course material?

**Everything** will be on the GitHub organization created for this course: <https://github.com/HEIG-VD-DAI-Course>.

More specifically, the course material is available in the [`HEIG-VD-DAI-Course`](https://github.com/HEIG-VD-DAI-Course/HEIG-VD-DAI-Course) Git repository. PDFs can be found in the "[Releases](https://github.com/HEIG-VD-DAI-Course/HEIG-VD-DAI-Course/releases)" of this repository.

No Microsoft Teams, no CyberLearn, no bullshit. I want to keep it simple and efficient for you and me and use real tools that work.

_PS: I accept pull requests if you spot anything weird!_

## Communication channels

- GitHub Discussions (you will experiment this in the next practical session)
- In person
- Email
    - [ludovic.delafontaine@heig-vd.ch](mailto:ludovic.delafontaine@heig-vd.ch)
    - [hadrien.louis@heig-vd.ch](mailto:hadrien.louis@heig-vd.ch)



## Course sequence

1. Theoretical content (maximum 1 hour)
    - It is meant to be short, interactive and useful
    - Quizzes, discussions, etc.
2. Practical content (minimum 30 minutes)
    - You will be able to experiment the theoretical content
    - Allow you to prepare the tools for the pratical work session
3. Pratical work (the time available should be sufficient)
    - Bigger work to get deeper into the subject

## Program

## Evaluation

## Responsabilities and expectations

- My responsabilities:
    - You have acquired the necessary knowledge of this course
    - You are prepared for the professional world
    - You are able to work in a team
    - You are able to work on your own

- Your responsabilities: you are responsible for your own learning. If you have any questions, ask them. If you have any difficulties, let me know. If you have any suggestions, share them.

## _"A course in English..?"_

Only the slides will be in English, the course will be in French.

If you have any difficulties with English, please let me know.

## _"What about ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.?"_

You can use all the tools you want (personal notes, Internet, ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.), even during evaluations. My statement is that you will be able to use these in the real world, so better learn how to use them now. However, they are here to help you, not to do the work for you:

- You must be able to explain what you did and why you did it
- You must state it when you used external help (tools and sources)
- You must be able to do the work on your own. These tools come and go ($$$, end of life, etc.), you should not entirely rely on them. 

## Questions
